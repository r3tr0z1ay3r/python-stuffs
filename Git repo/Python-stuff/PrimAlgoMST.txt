Algorithm:

Step 1
Step 2: We create a adjacency matrix to represnt a graph with the vertices being 5
Step 3: We create a list to save all the selected edges for the MST to be formed
Step 4: We intialise a variable to make sure that the edges joined is less than the vertex 
Step 5: The first element of the selected list is update to the value True
Step 6: A while loop is intialised with the edge variable being lower than vertex as condition
Step 7: Three variables are intialised with two having 0 as value and one having inf as value
Step 8: A for loop is created with i as control variable with range of vertex
Step 9: Another nested loop with control variable j is executed if the selected edge of index i is True
Step 10: If the element of selected list of index j and if there is a element in g[i][j] the next step is exectued or is skipped
Step 11: The minimum is compared with the matrix element, If the minimum is greater than the matrix element minimum is updated to the matrix element
Step 12: The values of x and y are also updated and to i and j respectively
Step 13: The edge with its weight is printed and the edge at y is updated to true in the selected list
Step 14: The value of the edge variable is incremented by 1 and the loop is repeated until failure of condition
Step 15: STOP

     [9, 0, 95, 19, 42],
     [75, 95, 0, 51, 66],
     [0, 19, 51, 0, 31],
     [0, 42, 66, 31, 0]]

    y = 0
    for i in range(V):

            for j in range(V):

                        minimum = G[i][j]
                        x = i
                        y = j
    print(str(x) + "-" + str(y) + "\t\t:\t\t" + str(G[x][y]))
    selected[y] = True
    no_edge += 1

Output:
